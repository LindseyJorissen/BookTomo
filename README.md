**BookTomo Graph Engine**
An experimental graph-based recommendation and visualization system built with NetworkX and Pydantic.
It models books, authors and genres as a network to generate explainable reading recommendations.


**BookTomo** is a year-in-review app for readers — think *Spotify Wrapped*, but for books.  

It takes your reading data (from a Goodreads CSV export) and turns it into fun, visual stats you can share.
